          <h3 class="article-title">The birth of Photography</h3>
          <p class="article-body">
            The earliest “cameras” weren’t used so much to take pictures as they
            were to study optics. Camera obscuras demonstrate how light can be
            used to project an image onto a flat surface. The basic idea of this
            natural optical phenomenon is very simple. Light passing through a
            tiny hole in one wall will project an image onto the opposing wall.
            The resulting projection is an upside down image and the birth of
            photography.

          <h3 class="article-title">Invention of Camera</h3>
          <p class="article-body">
            In 1829, Louis Daguerre received credit for developing practical
            photography. This technology was sold to the French government. In
            1840, it was Alexander Wolcott who invented the first camera that
            made photographs that did not fade quickly.

          <h3 class="article-title">Camera Nowadays (Digital Camera)</h3>
          <p class="article-body">
            The first true-type digital camera arrived in 1988 as Fuji DS-1P.
            However, the major revolution in this field came with the Kodak DCS
            series of Digital SLR cameras. These cameras used to capture and
            store pictures on a 16 GB memory chip in the JPEG format. However,
            consumer cameras were launched only by 1995. Since then, digital
            consumer cameras and DSLRs have become the talk of the town and new
            innovations are constantly on in this field. From face detection to
            new file formats and from the optical viewfinder to point and shoot
            features, Digital cameras have come a long way in a very short
            period of time.
